🐍 Snake Game — HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This project is a simple Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The snake moves across the grid, eats food to grow longer, and the player must avoid crashing into the walls or the snake’s own body.
It is a beginner-friendly project that helped me improve my JavaScript logic building, including concepts like event handling, game loops, collision detection, and dynamic UI updates.
